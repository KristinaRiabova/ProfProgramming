For User Story (a):

The program shall accept a list of numbers as input.
The program should be able to identify and return the largest negative value from the provided list.
If no negative values are present in the list, the program should return a suitable message indicating so.
The program should handle integer in the input list.
The solution should be efficient and scalable for large lists of numbers.

For User Story (b):

The program shall accept three coefficients (a, b, and c) representing a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c.
The program should calculate the roots of the quadratic equation.
If the equation has real roots, the program should return them as output.
If the equation has complex roots, the program should return them as well.
The program should handle cases where the quadratic equation has one or two real roots, or two complex roots.
The program should provide accurate results even for equations with large coefficients.
The solution should handle cases where the discriminant is zero, indicating that the equation has only one real root.
